WHAT IT IS:

* A bingo board
* Randomizes content on each load
* Reads square data from the data.js file
* Uses data attributes to check for win condition
* Uses CSS transitions for all animation
* Uses HTML5 audio for UI feedback
* Uses jquery.tappable.js to improve performance on mobile

HOW TO USE:

All data is kept in the "data.js" file. Customize the .json in the data.js file to change the language on the board.
